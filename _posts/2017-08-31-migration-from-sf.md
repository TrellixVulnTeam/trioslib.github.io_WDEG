We have migrated TRIOSlib from SourceForge in order to facilitate contributions. Fortunately, there has been some insterest in improving TRIOSlib from other graduate students, so we are now hosting it in Github under the organization *trioslib*. 

We are also hosting a new website on github as well (this one :) and we will update it with documentation and other information about works that use TRIOSlib.
